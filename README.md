# tennis-web-scraper
This repository contains python module that scrapes tennis matches statistics from flashscore.com web site and saves collected data into a csv file.

The code makes use of mainly selenium and pandas packages.

As an example of the output, see attached indian-wells-2023.csv file with scraped Indian wells 2023 tournament's matches.

You can easily add/remove match statistics depending on your needs and also add more tournaments to scrape through, in which case one tournament will be scraped at a time.
